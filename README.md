## Resource Policies & ACLs

S3 is private by default (only accessible by the account root user of the account which created it)

Resouce policies (who can access that resource) and identity policies (what that identity can access) can be used:
  - Identity policies are limited, because identity policies can only be attached to identities in **own** account
  - Resource policies can ALLOW/DENY same or different account and anonymous principal

```json
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Principal": "*",
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:GetObjectVersion"
         ],
         "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*",
      }
   ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the is a `Principal` it should be a Resource Policy, if not it should be an Identity policy

Other policies:
- Access Control List (limited and deprecated)
- Block Public Access (safeguard for public bucket)
