# 📝 CloudFormation

CloudFormation is a tool to create, update and delete resources in AWS using a **Template** written in `YAML` or `JSON`.

## 🧩 Components of a Template

- `Resources`: at least one, each one is called a logical resources (contains a `Type` and `Properties`)
- `Description`: must follow `AWSTemplateFormatVersion` (if present)
- `Metadata`: control what is display in the console/UI
- `Parameters`: what is prompt to the user (for user input or select values)
- `Mappings`: key/value pairs which can be used for lookups
- `Conditions`: create a condition (then we can use it with its name in other components)
- `Outputs`: when the template is finished it can present outputs based on waht has been created, updated or deleted (e.g. ID of the created instance)

## 🏗️ Physical and Logical Resources

CloudFormation **Template** are used to create one or multiple **Stacks**.

- A stack creates/updates/deletes **Physical resources** based on the **Logical resources** described in the template
- **Logical resources** have a `Name`, a `Type` (e.g. `AWS::EC2::Instance`) and various `Properties`.

> [!NOTE]
> For any **logical resources** in the stack, CloudFormation makes a corresponding **physical resource** in the AWS account (and keep it in sync: update, delete)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once the physical resource is created, its attributes can be queried within the template.

## 🕹️ Template and Pseudo Parameters

### 👾 Template Parameters

- Accept **inputs** (via the Console, CLI or API) when a stack is created or updated (e.g. the environment that the template is for: `dev`, `test`, `prod`)
- Can be **referenced** from within **Logical Resources** ➡️ Influence **Physical Resources** and/or configuration
- Can be configured with `Defaults`, `AllowedValues`, `Min` and `Max` length, `AllowedPattern`, `NoEcho` & `Type`

### 👾 Pseudo Parameters

- Provided by AWS: they exist even if you don't define them in the parameter section of the template (it's like they are injected by AWS into the template and stack) - Can be referenced wherever needed
- E.g. `AWS:Region`, `AWS:StackId`, `AWS:StackName`, `AWS:AccountId`

## ⚙️ Intrinsic Functions

Gain access to data at runtime: template can take actions based on how things are when the template is being used to create a stack.

- `Ref` & `Fn::GetAtt` allow to reference a value from one logical resource (or parameter) in another one
- `Fn::Join` & `Fn::Split` allow to join strings together or split them
- `Fn::GetAZs` can be used to get a list a AZ for a given AWS region
- `Fn::Select` allow to select one element from a list
- `Fn::If`, `Fn::And`, `Fn::Equals`, `Fn::Not`, `Fn::Or` can be used to provision resources based on conditional checks (e.g. if a parameter is set to prod then deploy a bigger instance)
- `Fn::Base64` allow to provide base64 encoded text to a resource
- `Fn::Sub` allow to substitute text based on runtime information
- `Fn::Cidr` allow to automatically configure the network ranges subnets
- `Fn::ImportValue`, `Fn::FindInMap`, `Fn::Transform`

## 🔗 Mappings

**Improve Template Portability**.

- Templates can contain a Mappings object... which can contain many mappings
- Map keys to values, allowing lookup (can have one `Key` or `Top` & `Second` level)
- Mappings use the `Fn::FindInMap` intrinsic function
- Common use: retrieve AMI for given region & architecture

## 🔊 Outputs

Useful to provide status information or showing how to access services which are created by a CloudFormation stack.

- Optional
- Visible as outputs when using the CLI or in the console UI
- Accessible from a **parent stack** when using **nesting**

## 🔀 Conditions

- Processed **BEFORE** resources are created
- Use the other intrinsic functions **AND, EQUALS, IF, NOT, OR**
- Can be associated with logical resources to control if they are created or not (e.g. how many AZs are already created)
- Conditions can be nested

## 🤝 DependsOn

- CloudFormation tries to be efficient by doing things in parrallel (create, update & delete)
- However, it will try to determine a **dependency order** (e.g. VPC ➡️ SUBNET ➡️ EC2)
- **DependsOn** allows to explicitly define any dependencies between resources

> [!NOTE]
> For example, if resource B depends on resource A, then CF will wait until resource A is complete before starting to create resource B.

## 🚦 Wait Conditions & Signal

A stack can be in **CREATE_COMPLETE** state but a resource behind it can fail (e.g. an EC2 instance).

- `cfn-signal` wait for **X number of success signal** and/or wait for a **timeout** (12 hour max) before indicating the **CREATE_COMPLETE** state (if failures signal is received or timeout is reached then the creation fails)
- Both `WaitCondition` & `CreationPolicy` delay the creation of the stack until they receive a specified number of "success signals"
- `WaitCondition` is a CloudFormation **RESOURCE** in itself, whereas `CreationPolicy` is an **ATTRIBUTE** associated with other resources
- Currently, only `AutoScalingGroup`, `EC2` Instance & `WaitCondition` resources support the `CreationPolicy` attribute

## 🧱 Nested Stacks & Cross-Stack References

- Resources in a single stack **share a lifecycle**
- A stack can have a maxmum of `500` resources
- A stack is **isolated** and **self-contained** by design: can't easily reference or reuse resources from another stack ➡️ **Nested Stacks** or **Cross-Stack References** can help

### 🪆 Nested Stacks

- **Root Stack** is created first
- **Parent Stack** contains multiple stacks (its own nested stack)
- Useful for modular templates (code reuse)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Can only reference **OUTPUTS**, cannot directly reference logical resources

🎒 **Exams**

- Wholes templates can be reused in other stacks (will create new and distinct resources)
- Use only when everything is **lifecycle linked** (when the stacks form part of one solution)

### ↕️ Cross-Stack References

Useful when we want a stack to be able to reference the resources created in another (in order to reuse those actual resources).

- Outputs are normally not visible from other stacks: cannot use the built-in `Ref` function (except for nested stacks)
- Outputs can be **EXPORTED**, making them visible from other stacks
- Exports must have a **UNIQUE name** in the region
- `Fn::ImportValue` can be used instead of `Ref`
- Use for Service-Oriented & different lifecycles & Stack Reuse

## 🌎 StackSets

Deploy CFN stacks across many accounts & regions.

- StackSets are **CONTAINERS** in an **admin account**
- Contain stack **INSTANCES** (❗not the same thing as stack, more like a reference to a stack)
- Stack instances & stacks are in **target accounts**
- Each stack = 1 region in 1 account
- Security: **self-managed** or **service-managed**

## 🧽 Deletion Policy

- If you delete a logical resource from a template then the physical resource is deleted: this can cause data loss
- With deletion policy we can define on each resource: `Delete` (default), `Retain` (physical resources remain untouched when the Stacks logical resources are removed) or `Snapshot` (if supported)
- Snapshots continue on past Stack lifetime (need to clean up $$)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ONLY APPLIES TO DELETE, NOT REPLACE.

## 🧢 Stack Roles

- CFN uses the permissions of the **logged in identity**: it means that the identity need permissions to create, update or delete stacks or resources
- This can be a problem for large team since the dev updating the stack is not the same as the one who created it
- To address this issue CFN can **assume a role** (role is attached to the stack) to **gain the permissions**
- The identity creating the stack does not need resource permissions - only `PassRole`
- This lets us implement **role separation**

## ✨ CloudFormation cfn-init

The `cfn-init` helper script reads template metadata from the `AWS::CloudFormation::Init` key and acts accordingly to:

- Fetch and parse metadata from CloudFormation
- Install packages
- Write files to disk
- Enable/disable and start/stop services

> [!NOTE]
> `cfn-init` is run **once** as part of **bootstrapping** (user data) ➡️ if `AWS::CloudFormation::Init` it does not rerun.

## 🔄 CloudFormation cfn-hup

The `cfn-hup helper` is a daemon that **detects changes** in resource metadata and runs user-specified actions when a change is detected. This allows you to make **configuration updates** on your running Amazon EC2 instances through the `UpdateStack` API action.

## ✅ Change Sets

When you need to update a stack, understanding how your changes will affect running resources before you implement them can help you update stacks with confidence. Change sets allow you to **preview how proposed changes to a stack might impact your running resources**, including the impact on resource properties and attributes. 

Whether your changes will delete or replace any critical resources, CloudFormation makes the changes to your stack only when you decide to execute the change set, allowing you to decide whether to proceed with your proposed changes or explore other changes by creating another change set.

## 🧩 Custom Resources

CloudFormation does not support everything, so Custom Resources let CFN integrate with anything it doesn't yet or doesn't natively support.

Passes data to something, gets data back from something.
