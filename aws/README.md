## 🏘️ Accounts

When creating an AWS Account, you provide an account name (e.g. PROD), a unique address email and a credit card.

An AWS Account is a container for `Identities` (users) and `Resources`.

By default all access to an AWS Account & resources is denied, except for the account root user.

The account root user has full control over all AWS Account and any resources created within it & cannot be restricted.

Identity and Access Management (IAM) Users, Groups and Roles can be created and given FULL or LIMITED permissions.

Use separate account for separate things (DEV, TEST, PROD) or products or clients.

## 📟 Multi-Factor Authentication

Factor means a piece of evidence which prove identity, it can be based on:

- Knowledge: something you know (username, password)
- Possession: something you have (bank card, MFA device or app)
- Inherent: something you are (fingerprint, face, voice, iris)
- Location: a physical or network location

Because a factor can be leaked, more factors means more security and harder to fake !
